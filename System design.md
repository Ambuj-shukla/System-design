# What Is System Design?

System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. In software engineering, it‚Äôs about designing scalable, efficient, and maintainable software systems, especially those used at large scale like social media platforms, e-commerce sites, or cloud services.

# üîç Why Is System Design Important?
Ensures the system can handle growth in users and data

Improves performance, scalability, and reliability

Helps break down complex problems into manageable parts

Crucial for building real-world software products

Common in tech interviews at companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, etc.

# üß± Key Concepts in System Design
1. High-Level Design
Defines the overall architecture

Describes how different components interact

Example: Web client ‚Üî Load Balancer ‚Üî Application Servers ‚Üî Database

2. Low-Level Design
Focuses on class-level or module-level design

Defines logic, data flow, APIs, class diagrams, etc.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Common System Components
Component	Purpose
Load Balancer	Distributes traffic evenly across servers
Application Server	Hosts backend logic
Database	Stores structured or unstructured data
Cache (e.g. Redis)	Speeds up frequent reads and reduces DB load
Message Queue	Enables asynchronous communication (e.g. Kafka, RabbitMQ)
CDN	Delivers static content close to users
API Gateway	Manages and routes external API calls

# üìê Design Considerations
When designing a system, engineers must evaluate:

Concern	Description
Scalability	Can the system grow with more users/data?
Reliability	Will it stay functional under failure or errors?
Availability	Is the system always reachable? (e.g., 99.99% uptime)
Latency	How fast does the system respond?
Consistency	Does everyone see the same data at the same time?
Maintainability	Is it easy to update, debug, and improve?
Security	How are users/data protected from threats?

# üß† Common Topics in System Design Interviews
Design a URL shortener (like bit.ly)

Design a messaging system (like WhatsApp)

Design a scalable file storage system (like Google Drive)

Design rate limiter, cache, load balancer, search engine

Trade-offs between SQL vs NoSQL, microservices vs monolith

# üìò Example System Design: URL Shortener
Requirements:
Shorten a long URL

Redirect to the original URL

Handle billions of requests

Design:
Frontend UI

Application service to create short codes (e.g., base62 encoding)

Database to store mappings

Cache frequently used links

Optional: Rate limiting, analytics, authentication

# üéØ Final Thought
System Design is not about just writing code ‚Äî it's about thinking holistically, anticipating real-world challenges, and creating software that performs reliably at scale.
